# Tartrazine-Induced Skin Transparency in Mice

[Link to MY Relevant Presentation](https://www.figma.com/deck/CvLVfrjM53WDm3f0cAvqaa)

This repository contains a research study examining the effects of tartrazine, a common yellow food dye, on the transparency of mouse skin. The study explores the potential applications of this phenomenon in non-invasive imaging and its implications for biomedical research and clinical practice.

## Project Overview

Recent research has demonstrated that tartrazine can temporarily render mouse skin transparent when applied topically. This discovery opens new doors for non-invasive imaging techniques in biological systems and has potential applications in fields like neurology, oncology, and developmental biology.

### Key Findings:
- Tartrazine can make living mouse skin transparent within minutes.
- The transparency allows direct visualization of internal structures like blood vessels and muscles.
- The effect is reversible, and no significant health impacts were found in short-term studies.

## Images

## Methodology
1. **Tartrazine Application**: Mice were treated with a solution of tartrazine on various parts of the body, including the scalp, abdomen, and hindlimb.
2. **Imaging**: Time-lapse laser speckle contrast imaging was used to visualize the transparency of the tissue over time.
3. **Histology**: Samples were collected for histological analysis to assess tissue changes.
4. **Safety Assessment**: Mice were monitored for body weight changes and blood counts to evaluate the potential side effects of tartrazine treatment.

## Conclusion
Tartrazine-induced transparency in living tissues presents a promising approach for non-invasive imaging. Future work will focus on optimizing this technique for human application and exploring its use in clinical diagnostics and adaptive sports.
